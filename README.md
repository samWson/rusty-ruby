# Rusty Ruby
Learn how Ruby works by implementing it in Rust.

## Description
A good way to understand how something works is to make it. The goal of this project is to implement a Ruby interpreter using the Rust programming language.

## Usage
The program can currently do the first stage of interpreting a Ruby program: Tokenization. A ruby file provided as an argument and the program outputs the resulting tokens.
```
$ cargo run sample_ruby.rb
```

### Limitations
Currently only the most basic syntax will be supported. The example program `sample_ruby.rb` gives an indication of what can be tokenized. As the supported syntax grows more expression can be added to `sample_ruby.rb`.
```
x = 2 + 3
```
